Your images resized, responsive, and retina ready with all the magic happening in the cloud.

## Description

Resize.ly is a plugin that goes hand in hand with the Resize.ly dynamic (re)sizing image service.

Please see http://resize.ly for more information.

## Beta Notice

We're currently in Beta, thanks for your patience!

## Features

* Resizes images on the client side using a cloud based service.

* Super easy CDN integration.

## Note

If you are not a subscribing member to Resize.ly you'll see small watermarks on your images.

2. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
3. Set the various options on the Settings > Resize.ly page
